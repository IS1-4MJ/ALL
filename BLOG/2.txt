TODAY, I STUDY APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (API's)

PLACE: https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-an-api/
THERE ARE 4 MAIN KIND API AS OPEN API, PARTNER API, INTERNAL API, COMPOSISTE API

THERE IS NOT ONE ACCESS RESTRICTION IF OPEN API
THERE IS SPECIFIC RIGHT ELSE SPECIFIC LICENSE ACCESS RESTRICTION IF PARTNER API. (NOT AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC)
THERE IS INSIDE COMPANY USE PRIMARILY ACCESS RESTRICTION IF INTERNAL API
THERE IS DATA + SERVICE TASK SEQUENCE SYNCHRONOUS RUN AFTER EXECUTION (NOT REQUEST) OF A TASK IF COMPOSITE API. (USED PRIMARILY TO SPEED UP PROCESS OF EXECUTION AND IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF LISTENERS INSIDE WEB INTERFACES).


ONE ADDRESS IS USED MOST TIME AS API ENDPOINT. DO API INTERACT WITH API ENDPOINT.
COMMONLY, ENDPOINT NAME (ADDRESS) CORRESPONDS TO FUNCTIONALITY IT PROVIDES.

KINDS OF ACTIONS:
GET AS REQUEST DATA FROM SERVER.
POST AS ADD NEW DATA TO THE SERVER. 
PUT AS CHANGE EXISTING INFORMATION.
DELETE AS DELETE EXISTING INFORMATION

HOW TO USE AN API:
1. GET ONE API KEY. (SOMEHOW REGISTER WITH THE API SERVER AND ENTER IDENTITY DATA)
2. TEST API ENDPOINT (USE A REST CLIENT ?)
3. USE THE API!





CONCLUSION:
API ARE INTEGRAL PART OF MODERN DEVELOPMENT ECOSYSTEM.
BIG VALUE. (BIG BANG / SMALL BUCK)
