# ALL

THIS IS MY PERSONAL SITE! (https://github.com/IS1-4MJ/ALL)

I DO MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. 

I STUDY FOR A MASTERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS.

I GRADUATED FROM EARLHAM COLLEGE IN 2021 WITH A DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS.


I LIKE PUSHING SIMPLE ALGORITHMS TO THE LIMITS, CONNECTIVE WORK, AND PERCEPTION. I CODED BEFORE 2011. I CONTINUE TO CODE TODAY IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE I NEED.

I ORGANIZE MY GITHUB LIKE A FILE SYSTEM FOR YOUR FAMILIAR ACCESS. 

THE STRUCTURE IS
    ALL/
        BLOG/
        CODE/
        MATH/
        IMAGE/ 


YOU CAN SEE MATH I COME UP WITH INSIDE ALL/MATH/* ,  CODE I MAKE INSIDE ALL/CODE/* , AND MORE FROM ME INSIDE ALL/BLOG/* ,.
ALL/IMAGE/ REALLY IS JUST A WAY TO GET URLS... I WOULDN'T SPEND ANY TIME THERE.

SEE ANY THING YOU WANT WITH THE DESCRIPTION AS THE COMMIT TITLE. 


WHY NOT GET STARTED IN ALL/BLOG/*,? I POST WHAT I JUST WORKED ON THERE! :)

THANKS! ENJOY YOUR TIME HERE
